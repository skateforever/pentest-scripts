             Ps: To setup the list of countries you must edit the configuration
             file. This options will control how the script will manipulate the
             TOR ENTRY NODE and the TOR EXIT NODE.
       
             The options for the (R)elay (E)nforcing are:
             1) entry: Sets a specific country as ENTRY relay
                       and will use a different country as EXIT relay.
                       The load balancing algorithm is: Round Robin. 

             2) exit:  Sets a specific country as EXIT relay
                       and will use a different country as ENTRY relay.
                       This option give you the control of the EXIT relays and
                       could be used to bypass GeoIP protections.
                       Whoever reduces the number of EXIT realys available.
                       The load balancing algorithm is: Round Robin.

             3) speed: This option is the fastest option because reduces the 
                       delay between the hops of relays inside TOR network by 
                       setting the same country as ENTRY and EXIT node.
                       All other countries will be set as EXCLUDE NODES, so the
                       middle relay will hopefully also be selected inside the
                       same country.
                       The load balancing algorithm for this option is: 
                       Least Connections Round Robin.
                       This algorithm sends the next request for the instances
                       with least number of request in the queue but still 
                       performing the load balancing between all other instances.
                 
                       Do not use this option for sensitive activities because
                       it could reduce the security if you consider that your
                       adversary could easily compromise a TOR ENTRY-NODE and 
                       a TOR EXIT-NODE in the same country.
                       Some contries doesn't have ENTRY GUARDS and EXIT NODES
                       enougth to create valid circuits.
                       Keep your eyes on the health check URL to identify
                       countries with this issue. By default the health check is:
