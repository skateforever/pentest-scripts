## Informational

I made these scripts for my needs and tried to understand a little bit of how some bug hunters work and put some of those steps in a logical order for me. </br>
Until I consider this work finished, I'll continue to study and saw how some people work and put it in features within collector script. :D </br>
</br>
Here in this README.md I put just the list of main scripts and a little bit of information about your functionality. </br>
Any other secondary scripts in this repository will have it's description in the script header.

## Main scripts

 - **collector**: can be find in recon directory and your funcionality is subdomain and web data discovery;
 - **g4sp4rz1nh0**: modified splitter to create a infraestructure to anonizamtion during pentest to avoid WAF/Firewall block to our IP. If you need to understand how it's works, you need to see this [link](https://github.com/renergr1nch/splitter);
 - **get-tools**: can be find in useful directory and prepare the operation system to collector and get other tools to help in pentest;
 - **seek-leak**: tool to search for leaks on onion network.
